# Description
### Data compression, also called compaction, the process of reducing the amount of data needed for the storage or transmission of a given piece of information, typically using encoding techniques.


### Implement Huffman coding algorithm for lossless data compression.
### **Details:**
### o Given a file, you should compress its data using Huffman coding algorithm, then save the result in another file.
### o Also given a compressed file with its Huffman tree, you should decompress it, then save result in another file.
### The algorithm works as follows:
### There are mainly two major parts in Huffman Coding: 1) Build a Huffman Tree from input characters. 2) Traverse the Huffman Tree and assign codes to characters.
